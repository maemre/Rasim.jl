# Rasim.jl

Rasim (RAdio network SIMulator) is a simple time-slot-based simulator for cognitive radio
networks. Rasim.jl is port of rasim to Julia. I created the port mainly because the
performance (simulation time) I was getting in Python was not satisfactory for my graduation
project.

As I added new features for my proposed algorithm, Rasim.jl became more complicated than and
a successor of Rasim.

# Dependencies

The current dependency list is:

* Gadfly
* HDF5
* DataFrames

and Winston if you want to draw plots right after simulation.

# How to run

Firstly set the parameter set you want to simulate by modifying `Params.jl`, which is used like more or less a config file. Do not forget to modify parameters generated by `genparam()` function. Then add your agents along project files and import them from Rasim by modifying `Rasim.jl`. Lastly, add your agents to array `agent_types`. If you want to make a single run, just import `Rasim` and `Params` from a script and call `Rasim.run_whole_simulation(p)` where `p` is the parameter set you configure (a variable of type `ParamT`). IF you want to run a set of simulations parallelly, use `RunParallel.jl` but don't forget to modify the first line to match number of your machine's CPU cores and set `batch_run` parameter to `true` in `Params.jl`. You can also run Rasim.jl over a network of machines by writing a small Julia script.
