# Rasim.jl

Rasim (RAdio network SIMulator) is a simple time-slot-based simulator for cognitive radio
networks. Rasim.jl is port of rasim to Julia. I created the port mainly because the
performance (simulation time) I was getting in Python was not satisfactory for my graduation
project.

As I added new features for my proposed algorithm, Rasim.jl became more complicated than and
a successor of Rasim.
