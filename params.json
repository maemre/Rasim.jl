{"name":"Rasim.jl","tagline":"A time-slot based radio network simulator written in Julia","body":"# Rasim.jl\r\n\r\nRasim (RAdio network SIMulator) is a simple time-slot-based simulator for cognitive radio\r\nnetworks. Rasim.jl is a port of rasim to Julia. I created the port mainly because the\r\nperformance (simulation time) I was getting in Python was not satisfactory for my graduation\r\nproject. As I added new features for my proposed algorithm, Rasim.jl became more complicated than and\r\na successor of Rasim.\r\n\r\nYou can change simulation parameters in `Params.jl` and add your own agents in seperate Julia files. To simulate your new agent type, add it to the `agent_types` list in `Rasim.jl`. Then, you can run the simulation by running\r\n\r\n~~~\r\njulia Rasim.jl\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nin the command line.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
